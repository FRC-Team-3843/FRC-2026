# FRC-2026 Season Context
## Current Sprint Status & Shared Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

## Project Status

**Phase:** Pre-Season Development
**Active Robot:** `2026Robot/`
**Build Status:** Initial setup complete

## Current Sprint Goals

### Week 1-2 (January 2026)
- [ ] Set up base robot framework (command-based)
- [ ] Configure swerve drive system
- [ ] Establish subsystem architecture
- [ ] Implement basic teleop control

### Upcoming Tasks
- Vision system integration (PhotonVision)
- Autonomous path planning setup
- Initial mechanism subsystems (TBD based on game)

## Known Issues / Blockers

(None currently - project in initial setup)

## Team Decisions & Context

### Architecture Decisions
- **Framework:** WPILib Command-Based (strict dependency injection)
- **Drive:** Swerve drive with YAGSL library
- **Vision:** PhotonVision on coprocessor
- **Autonomous:** PathPlanner for path following

### Hardware Configuration
- **Drive Motors:** TalonFX (Phoenix6 API)
- **Mechanism Motors:** SparkMax (REVLib 2025+ API)
- **CAN Bus:** Standard assignments (see CLAUDE.md)

### Code Standards
- **Java Version:** 17
- **API Standards:** 2026 strict (see GEMINI.md)
- **No Legacy Patterns:** Do not copy from FRC-2024/2025 without refactoring

## Active Development Areas

### Subsystems In Development
(None currently - starting from template)

### Subsystems Planned
- DriveSubsystem (swerve)
- VisionSubsystem
- (Mechanism subsystems TBD based on game reveal)

## Testing Notes

**Simulation:** Available via `./gradlew simulateJava`
**Hardware Testing:** Awaiting robot build
**Driver Station:** Team 3843 configuration

## Important Reminders

- Always use 2026 motor APIs (SparkMax, not CANSparkMax)
- Check `.agent-log\changelog.md` before major work
- Log all significant changes for cross-agent coordination
- Verify CAN IDs before deploying to hardware
